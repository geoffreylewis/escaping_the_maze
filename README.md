In my ongoing quest to refresh my Python skills and stay sharp, I'm working my way through the Udemy course "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp".  Shout out to Dr. Angela Yu and Udemy.  

Another shout out to Andr√© Roberge and any others who are in charge of "Reeborg's World" at https://reeborg.ca/index_en.html; it's a fun little arena to practice in with Python.
